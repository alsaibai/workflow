![CI/CD POC Workflow](https://github.com/alsaibai/workflow/actions/workflows/android.yml/badge.svg)

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a **Proof of Concept (POC)** for a CI/CD workflow tailored for Android applications. The workflow is designed to streamline the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring efficient development cycles.

## Features

- **Multi-Branch Support**: The workflow accommodates multiple branches (`dev`, `UAT`, `main`) to facilitate various stages of development.
- **Job Automation**: Each stage (build, shield, deploy, release) is automated through GitHub Actions, allowing for continuous integration and deployment.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Follow the status of your CI/CD pipeline with the badge above.

## Getting Started

To get started with the workflow:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alsaibai/workflow.git
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Environment**: Ensure you have the necessary tools installed for Android development.

3. **Push Changes**: Commit your changes to the desired branch to trigger the workflow.

4. **Monitor the Workflow**: Check the progress and results directly from the Actions tab in your GitHub repository.
